# Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach




## Description
Imagine that you are a group of established successful scientists that will team up to tackle an important biomedical and medical challenge. There is an open call for research proposals under a new umbrella program entitled “Artificial intelligence and computational (bio)medicine”, where your multidisciplinary group are aiming for a project on “Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach”.

The focus of the assignment is **(i)** description of relevant imaging technologies and modalities - at different scales, **(ii)** proposal of imaging-derived biomarkers for glioblastoma, **(iii)** machine learning techniques for classification, treatment stratification and prediction, **(iv)** the novelty and impact of your approach, and **(v)** the evaluation of the ethics of your project - and not so much the scientific background of brain cancer per se.




## Organization of your report

### Research plan
(3-5 pages incl. figures and bibliography)
 - A brief background to the field
 - Objectives and expected impact
 - Material and methods
 - Evaluation

### Data management plan and ethical considerations
(1 1/2-2 1/2 pages incl. graphics / links)
 - Description of generated data and code
 - Sharing of data and code
 - Ethical consideration
