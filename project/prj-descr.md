# Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach




## Description
Imagine that you are a group of established successful scientists that will team up to tackle an important biomedical and medical challenge. There is an open call for research proposals under a new umbrella program entitled “Artificial intelligence and computational (bio)medicine”, where your multidisciplinary group are aiming for a project on “Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma - a multiscale approach”.

The focus of the assignment is **(i)** description of relevant imaging technologies and modalities - at different scales, **(ii)** proposal of imaging-derived biomarkers for glioblastoma, **(iii)** machine learning techniques for classification, treatment stratification and prediction, **(iv)** the novelty and impact of your approach, and **(v)** the evaluation of the ethics of your project - and not so much the scientific background of brain cancer per se.




## Organization of your report
