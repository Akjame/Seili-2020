# NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020: Computational Biomedicine - Imaging, machine learning and precision medicine

![Seili-2020 image](./assets/Seili-2020.png)


NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020 is part of the “Open Educational Resources in Computational
Biomedicine (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by the [NordBioMed.org](https://nordbiomed.org/news/summer-school-2019) and funded by [Erasmus+](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647)project conducted by the NordBioMed.org and funded by Erasmus+.

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more comparative by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organisers intensive courses and develop virtual online teaching.

**The topic for the 2020 Summer school is computational biomedicine in brain tumours. This year the course will virtual due to the current situation with COVID-19.**



## Summer School Programme (preliminary)

**The Summer School has its start in beginning of summer and finish in end of September.
Exact dates for start and finish is not yet set. Before the week in August students go
through material on their own. During the course week online lectures are given with
possibilities to interact with teachers. Important part during this week is group project
where students from the participating universities form groups. After the course week
student groups continue to work with the project and deliver a report in the end of
September.**

**Students are signed in at University of Turku from where 5 credit points are given upon
completion of the course.**
