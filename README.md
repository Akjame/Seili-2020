# NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020: Computational Biomedicine - Imaging, machine learning and precision medicine

![Seili-2020 image](./assets/Seili-2020.png)


NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020 is part of the “Open Educational Resources in Computational
Biomedicine (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by the [NordBioMed.org](https://nordbiomed.org/news/summer-school-2019) and funded by [Erasmus+](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647)project conducted by the NordBioMed.org and funded by Erasmus+.

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more comparative by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organisers intensive courses and develop virtual online teaching.

**The topic for the 2020 Summer school is computational biomedicine in brain tumours. This year the course will virtual due to the current situation with COVID-19.**

## General information

### Learning aims:

Students will apply their previous knowledge to identify relevant and realistic topics/problems in the field of computational biomedicine. Students will work in groups of 4-5 students, each group is guided by a junior mentor. Based on the course material and guidance during the summer school, each group will develop and present a virtual preclinical research project to solve the selected problems. The final report/assignment which will be prepared individually in virtual work groups after the summer school.

### Contents:
**Before the summer school**<br>
- preliminary reading and assignments on NordBioMedNet Canvas

**During the summer school**<br>
- lectures
- team work
- student presentations
- practical exercises

**After the summer school**<br>
- independent work and virtual team work
- final report and press release

### Course structure
- All course material and information will be found on Canvas
- Lectures and group activities will be held  in Zoom
- Python course material at GitHub (https://github.com/oercompbiomed/Seili-2020)


### Volume: 5 ECTS

University of Turku will award 5 ECTS for all the participants after successful completion of the Summer School. Each participant receives a course certificate and a transcript. However, the final crediting will be done at the home university of each participant, and the home university has a right to change the amount of ECTS awarded.


## Summer School Programme (preliminary)

The Summer School has its start in June and finish in end of September. In June (exact date TBC) a package of pre-assignments will be sent out to participants and project groups will be formed – one student from each participating university in each group.

The week before the summer school starts in August introductory lecture will be held and the first start-up workshop. During the intensive course week online lectures are given with possibilities to interact with teachers. Group work is scheduled to afternoons between 12.00 – 18.00 (CET) for most of the days – estimated at least 4h/day active work in groups is needed. After the course week student groups continue to work with the projects on-line and in virtual meetings. The teams deliver a final report in the end of September (25.9.2020).

Students will work on Canvas platform (Karoliska Institutet) and data will be shared in GitHub. Students are signed in at University of Turku from where 5 ECTS are given upon completion of the course.

#### Pre-assignments in June:

**Bioethics (web-based) containing the following modules:**<br>
Module 1. Introduction to BioEthicsX<br>
Module 2. Research ethics in Biomedicine

**Python, R and friends:**<br>
A short introduction to programming and how to prepare yourself and
your computer for the computational exercises at the Summer School https://rise.articulate.com/share/Y-vw0ZckATqKqyh4u44c8p9YN-UEtr8r


#### Week 32 (TBC)

## Before the summer school
Before the summer school you have some assignments to do. It is up to you to plan when to do this during summer. 

#### 1. *Go through a module of a course in bioethics with focus on basic principles in bioethics* by following the two steps below. 
- Make an account in edX Edge: https://edge.edx.org/register
- Enroll to the module via the link: https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:KIx+KIBioEthicsX<br>
Niklas Juth from Karolinska Institutet  will work with you on some cases related to the theme of the summer school.


#### 2. *Prepare you and your computer for computational analysis*
If you are used to work with computer installations and github you can go directly to the material at github and use the guide for setting up your computer and perform notebook exercises. 

- **Python course material** at https://github.com/oercompbiomed/Seili-2020  – follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready

- **Browser** display and functionality might differ between browsers - we recommend using Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) on all platforms

- **Jupyter notebooks** are used throughout the course being a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks).

-  **Test your environment** [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nibabel, Biopython and more]: run through this notebook [`test-notebooks/0.0-test-installation.ipynb`](test-notebooks/0.0-test-installation.ipynb) to check that your environment is OK

- Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`. Remember also to start a new session with a `**git pull**` (things can have changed)


If you are less experienced you may want to visit our interactive course material first (see link below). It contains video instruction on how to set up your computer for the course and introduction to programming as well as the notebooks exercises.  
https://rise.articulate.com/share/Y-vw0ZckATqKqyh4u44c8p9YN-UEtr8r

(It is the **Python, R and Friends** part of our OpenEdx course transformed into a Rise course for the purpose of being pre-course material for the online Summer School). 

#### 3. *Orient yourself in the material for the group project and how to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) creating the report document*

- **Project description** (“_Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma – a multiscale approach_“) at prj-descr.md

- **LaTeX template for the report** at the latex (Links to an external site.) We will be using the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) online, collaborative LaTeX editor (for more information on LaTeX, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [here](https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-4/senthil/senthil.pdf) and [here](https://mildopinions.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/why-i-use-latex-in-biology), and for LeTeX templates, see e.g. [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-molecular-systems-biology/kyxgttpbzhht) and [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/academic-journal))
