# NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020: Computational Biomedicine - Imaging, machine learning and precision medicine

![Seili-2020 image](./assets/Seili-2020.png)


NordBioMedNet Summer School 2020 is part of the “Open Educational Resources in Computational
Biomedicine (OERCompBiomed) project conducted by the [NordBioMed.org](https://nordbiomed.org/news/summer-school-2019) and funded by [Erasmus+](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647)project conducted by the NordBioMed.org and funded by Erasmus+.

NordBioMed is a collaborative network in the field of Biomedicine between the Universities of Turku, Eastern Finland (Kuopio), Bergen, Odense and Karolinska Institutet. The network was originally formed in 2013 to strengthen the individual biomedical teaching programs within the component universities and make them internationally more comparative by providing complementary activities from the partner universities. The network supports both student and teacher mobility, organisers intensive courses and develop virtual online teaching.

**The topic for the 2020 Summer school is computational biomedicine in brain tumours. This year the course will virtual due to the current situation with COVID-19.**



## Summer School Programme (preliminary)

**The Summer School has its start in June and finish in end of September.
Exact dates for start and finish is not yet set. In June a package of pre-
assignments will be sent out to participants and project groups will be
formed – one student from each university in each group. The week
before the summer school starts in August introductory lecture will be
held and the first start-up work shop. During the course week online
lectures are given with possibilities to interact with teachers. Group work
is scheduled to afternoons between 12.00 – 18.00 (CET) for most of the
days – estimated at least 4h/day is needed. After the course week student
groups continue to work with the project and deliver a report in the end
of September.

**Students are signed in at University of Turku from where 5 credit points
are given upon completion of the course.**


### Pre-assignments:
**Bioethics (web-based) containing the following parts:**<br>
1. The basic concepts, theories, and principles in biomedical ethics
2. Research ethics for biomedical analytics.

**Python, R and friends:**<br>
A short introduction to programming and how to prepare yourself and
your computer for the computational exercises at the Summer School.<br>

# "Work load" / pre-assignment / project work / final report

## Work load

The workload reflects **5 ECTS**, and include (**i**) a pre-course period (pre-assignment), (**ii**) the one week lecture and instruction period August 10-14, and (**iii**) the post-course period for (group-wise) writing the project report with deadline in September.

## Pre-assignment 

### Setting up your system (preparation to the course)

**Follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready**

##### Browser
- Display and functionality might differ between browsers - we recommend using Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) on all platforms

#### Notebooks
The course is based on the Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk og https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks).

##### IMPORTANT (for making your own notebooks for coding experiments without conflict)
Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`. Remember also to start a new session with a `**git pull**` (things can have changed).


#### Get started - test your environment
* [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nibabel, Biopython and more]: run through this notebook [`test-notebooks/0.0-test-installation.ipynb`](test-notebooks/0.0-test-installation.ipynb) to check that your environment is OK.<br>
